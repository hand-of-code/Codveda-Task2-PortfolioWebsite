## HTML Structure Explained
1. `<!DOCTYPE html>` defines the document as HTML5.  
2. `<html lang="en">` sets English as the page language.  
3. The `<head>` section contains meta information, the page title, and the CSS link.  
4. `<body>` holds all visible content on the webpage.  
5. `<header>` serves as the introduction section, displaying my name and brief description.  
6. `<section id="projects">` is used to showcase my projects in a structured way.  
7. Each `<div class="project-card">` represents an individual project, containing the project title and description.  
8. `<section id="contact">` provides contact details, including email and LinkedIn link.  
9. `<a href="#">` allows users to navigate to external profiles or links.

## CSS Styling Explained
1. `* { margin:0; padding:0; box-sizing:border-box; }` resets default spacing for all elements.  
2. `body` sets font, background color, text color, and line spacing for the entire page.  
3. `header` centers the text, adds padding, a gradient background, and white text.  
4. `header h1` styles the main heading with a large font size and margin.  
5. `header p` styles the subheading with medium font size.  
6. `#projects` adds padding and white background for the projects section.  
7. `.project-card` adds border, padding, rounded corners, and a hover effect for interactivity.  
8. `.project-card:hover` changes the border color and scales the card for a smooth animation.  
9. `#contact` centers contact information and gives it a light gray background.  
10. `#contact a` styles links in blue, removes underline, and highlights them on hover with `#contact a:hover`.
